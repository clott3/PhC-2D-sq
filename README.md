# Predicting Bandstructures of 2D Square Photonic Crystals

## Introduction
This repo hosts the code used in [https://doi.org/10.1515/nanoph-2020-0197] where a simple neural network with CNN and fully connected layers was used to predict the bandstructures of 2D square lattice Photonic Crystals.

## Dataset
The dataset exceeds the upload limit of this repo. Access to the dataset can be made available upon request via email (tchr@mit.edu/ cloh@mit.edu).

## Usage
Upon cloning, the code can be run directly using ```run.py``` where the path to the directory containing the dataset should be specified using the ```--path_to_h5``` flag. The default hyperparameters defined in the parser will give the optimal results reported in the paper.
